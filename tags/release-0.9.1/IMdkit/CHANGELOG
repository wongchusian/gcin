This version by Steve Underwood, 1999/05/08
	The first stage of a clean up and bug fix for IMdkit.
	This version removes the obsolete and buggy XIMP support.
	It fixes a number of memory leaks in Xi18n support.
	It has been tidied up somewhat.
	The clean up is far from complete
	There are still memory leaks.
